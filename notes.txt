There is a problem with the edit invoice function. When the edit pencil is clicked,
the form data returned is from cache and not the most current data. 
Console.log on the edit /app/invoices/edit page.tsx shows the cached data on the 
terminal when the edit pencil is clicked. This old cache data is rendered.
